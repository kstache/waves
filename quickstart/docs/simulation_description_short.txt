The single element model is representative of the simplest model possible to exercise the capabilities of a WAVES
workflow. It is a single 2D square, plane-stress element oriented in the 1-2 plane consisting of a mock, linear-elastic
material model, simple boundary conditions, and applied uniaxial compression. The simulation preparation and solve are
conducted in Abaqus :cite:`ABAQUS`.
