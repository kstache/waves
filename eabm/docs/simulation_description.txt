The single element model is representative of the simplest model possible to exercise the capabilities of a WAVES
workflow. It is a single 2D square, plane-strain element oriented in the 1-2 plane consisting of a mock, linear-elastic
material model, simple boundary conditions, and applied uniaxial compression. The simulation preparation and solve are
conducted in Abaqus :cite:`ABAQUS`.

   Simulation schematic

The single element model is comprised of a single 2D square part with nominal dimensions 1mm x 1mm, but which can be
parameterized by width and height by the journal file: :mod:`eabm_package.abaqus.single_element_geometry`.

The bottom left node of the geometry is restricted in all six translational/rotational degrees of freedom using an
encastre boundary condition. The bottom edge uses a roller boundary condition, with no translation in the 2 direction,
but is free to move in the 1 direction.

Loading is prescribed as a uniaxial displacement of the top edge of the part in the negative 2 direction (compression),
with a nominal displacement of 0.1mm, which can be parameterized in the workflow.
