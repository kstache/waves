A ``diff`` against the ``SConstruct`` file from :ref:`tutorial_simulation_waves` is included below to help identify the
changes made in this tutorial.

.. admonition:: waves-tutorials/tutorial_cubit/SConstruct

   .. literalinclude:: tutorial_cubit_SConstruct
      :language: Python
      :diff: tutorials_tutorial_04_simulation_SConstruct

Note that the Cubit Python files don't perform any imports from the current modsim project package, so the
``PYTHONPATH`` modification is no longer required. This tutorial is created in a new, stand-alone subdirectory, so the
previous tutorial workflow configurations are no longer available. Only the ``sierra`` and ``abaqus`` workflow
configurations will be found by SCons at execution time. Finally, note that the ``cubit`` SConscript file is not called
by the ``SConstruct`` file. Instead, the ``cubit`` configuration is re-used by the ``sierra`` and ``abaqus`` workflows,
so the Cubit tasks only need to be defined once. To handle this task re-use some additional variable import and export
statements are required by the ``cubit`` configuration file.
