As mentioned in the :ref:`practices_introduction`, version control software fills the role of a laboratory notebook for
computational engineering. Keeping a laboratory notebook is a fundamental practice of experimental engineering and
science disciplines. They keep a record of who did what, when and how they did it, and why. Sometimes, they may even be
the original data records from experimental observations. Laboratory notebooks with bound pages and recorded in ink also
provide legal protections against fraud and to establish intellectual property (IP) precedence.

While there are software available that provide electronic laboratory notebooks, for computational practice version
control software provides a similar record of who, what, when, how, and why. Additionally, version control software
provides the usual benefits of version control such as the ability to uniquely reproduce the state of previous work and
the ability to manage and resolve content conflicts from contributors working in parallel.
