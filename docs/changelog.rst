0.4.4 (2022-09-19)
******************

New Features

- Add a ``waves quickstart`` subcommand to copy the single element compression project as a template for a new project.
  Currently limited to the "SCons-WAVES quickstart" tutorial files. (:issue:`284`, :merge:`300`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.
- Add a documentation template to the ``waves quickstart`` subcommand (:issue:`291`, :merge:`314`). By `Kyle Brindley`_.

Documentation
=============

  Brindley`_.
