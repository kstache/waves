Instead of incrementally modifying a single ``SConscript`` workflow file, each
tutorial will create a copy of the ``SConscript`` file and build on the
previous tutorial. Each tutorial will be a separate, stand-alone, fully
functional workflow. This is intended to help compare output file and behavior
changes between tutorials and to emphasize that a simulation project may
contain more than one simulation workflow.
