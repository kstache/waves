.. warning::

   The `AEA Conda channel`_ is not yet available from a webserver. Until the channel is webhosted, local, minimal
   `WAVES-EABM`_ Conda environments can only be created on ``sstelmo``, ``sstbigbird`` or AEA RHEL desktops with the
   method described below.

   .. code-block::

      $ conda create --name waves-eabm-env waves scons matplotlib pandas pyyaml xarray --channel file:///projects/aea_compute/aea-conda/ --channel conda-forge

   Advanced users may copy the `WAVES`_ package from the `AEA Conda channel`_ to their local machines and attempt the
   `WAVES`_ installation from a local file instead of from a Conda channel. Check the `AEA Conda channel`_ official
   documentation for updates in the channel access and availability.
