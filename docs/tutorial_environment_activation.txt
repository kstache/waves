`SCons`_ and `WAVES`_ can be installed in a `Conda`_ environment with the `Conda`_ package manager. See the `Conda
installation`_ and `Conda environment management`_ documentation for more details about using `Conda`_.

1. Create the tutorials environment if it doesn't exist

   .. code-block::

      $ conda create --name waves-tutorial-env waves scons matplotlib pandas pyyaml xarray --channel conda-forge

2. Activate the environment

   .. code-block::

      $ conda activate waves-tutorial-env

Some tutorials require additional third-party software that is not available for the `Conda`_ package manager. This
software must be installed separately and either made available to SConstruct by modifying your system's ``PATH`` or by
modifying the SConstruct search paths provided to the :meth:`waves.scons_extensions.add_program` method.
