`SCons`_ can be installed in a `Conda`_ environment with the `Conda`_ package manager. See the `Conda installation`_ and
`Conda environment management`_ documentation for more details about using `Conda`_. The `WAVES`_ package must be
installed from the `AEA Conda channel`_.

    **WARNING** The `AEA Conda channel`_ is not yet available from a webserver. Until the channel is webhosted, local,
    minimal `WAVES-EABM`_ Conda environments can only be created on ``sstelmo`` or AEA RHEL desktops with the method
    described below. Advanced users may copy the `WAVES`_ package from the `AEA Conda channel`_ to their local machines
    and attempt the `WAVES`_ installation from a local file instead of from a Conda channel. Check the `AEA Conda
    channel`_ official documentation for updates in the channel access and availability.

1. Create the environment if it doesn't exist

   .. code-block::

      $ conda create --name waves-eabm-env waves scons matplotlib pandas pyyaml xarray --channel file:///projects/aea_compute/aea-conda/ --channel conda-forge

2. Activate the environment

   .. code-block::

      $ conda activate waves-eabm-env
